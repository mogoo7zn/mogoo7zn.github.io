# Overview of 5 Models

![](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/over.webp)

In the model part ,we developed a series of mathematical models centered around the design of a yeast-based BoNT/A biosensor to systematically predict, optimize, and validate the system's key performance metrics. These models simulate the dynamic behavior of the sensor at different levels, encompassing cleavage efficiency, molecular interactions, protein expression dynamics, signal transduction pathways, and system-level detection performance. Specifically, they include:

+ ^1.Computationally Guided Optimization of SNAP-25 Mutants for Efficient BoNT/A Detection^

    Utilizing structure prediction (AlphaFold2), molecular docking (ClusPro 2.0), and dynamic simulations (AMBER/HADDOCK), this model evaluated the cleavage efficiency of SNAP-25 mutants (e.g., Δ199-202) and the binding affinity of their cleavage products to the Ste2 receptor. It identified the optimal mutant, providing a theoretical basis for protein engineering in wet-lab experiments.

+ ^2.Molecular Dynamics Simulation between the Fusion Protein and the Ste2 Receptor^

    Through 100 ns all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, this model verified that the fusion protein in its uncleaved state does not cause false positive signals due to steric hindrance, thereby enhancing system reliability and providing structural-level support for experimental design.

+ ^ 3.ODE for simulation of the fusion protein gene expression and shedding^

    This model established the dynamics from transcription, translation, and secretion to cell wall anchoring. It simulated the expression and loss of the fusion protein during yeast cultivation, lyophilization, and rehydration, confirming the feasibility and stability of using lyophilized yeast in detection assays.

+ ^4.System-Level Signal Transduction and Detection Performance Model^

    Constructed using Delay Differential Equations (DDEs), this system-level model simulated the entire signaling pathway from BoNT/A cleavage to the final generation of the yellow pigment (betaxanthin). It predicted the Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantification (LOQ), and identified key regulatory nodes through parameter sensitivity analysis, guiding the optimization of experimental conditions.

+ ^5.Model for Optimizing the Ratio of Substrate-acting and Signal-transferring Strains^

    Using three distinct mathematical approaches (diffusion model, kinetic model, and competition growth model), this study investigated the optimal ratio between the substrate-acting strain and the signal-transferring strain, providing initial ratio recommendations for co-culture experiments.

# 1 Computationally Guided Optimization of SNAP-25 Mutants for Efficient BoNT/A Detection

# 1.1 Objective
![Figure 1.1(wang,2025)](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/tail.webp)
    When botulinum toxin cleaves SNAP25, it leaves behind a 13-peptide tail, and since the alpha factor is also a 13-peptide in size, this raises a question: would the remaining tail affect the binding of the alpha factor to Ste2? If so, how can the SNAP25 sequence be modified to ensure that, while maintaining sufficient cleavage activity by botulinum toxin, the tailed alpha factor can still bind to Ste2 and trigger downstream responses?

    So we study the differences in cleavage efficiency of the BoNT/A light chain on SNAP-25 mutants (specifically, deletions in the 199-202 region) and  combine this analysis with the binding affinity of the resulting cleavage products to the Ste2 receptor. Our ultimate goal is to screen for the optimal mutant sequence.

# 1.2 Major Challenges

     ^Scarcity of Experimental Enzyme Kinetics Data^

        Initially, the plan was to quantify the impact of different amino acid mutations (in the 199-202 region) on cleavage efficiency by using corresponding enzyme kinetic parameters (kcat/Km). However, preliminary research revealed that such experimental data is extremely scarce, making this approach unfeasible.

     ^Inadequate Adaptability of Deep Learning Models for Protein Substrates^

        Subsequently, data-driven deep learning models were considered for predicting enzyme kinetic parameters. Benchmark tools like the CataPro model (Wang et al., 2025) are powerful but do not support reactions where the substrate is a protein. Fine-tuning a new model from scratch would be too time-consuming and would be hampered by a lack of sufficient training data.

![Figure 1.2: CataPro for predicting enzyme kinetic parameters of enzymatic reactions.](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/catapro.webp)


     ^Need to Quantify Both Cleavage Efficiency and Downstream Binding Effects^

        A comprehensive solution requires a method that can simultaneously quantify both the efficiency of the enzymatic cleavage and the binding affinity of the subsequent products to their downstream targets.

# 1.3 Calculation of Binding Efficiency

	 ^Structure Prediction and Preprocessing ^

        a.AlphaFold2 Prediction:

        Input:The amino acid sequences of the constructed full-length protein and four deletion mutants (in the 199-202 region).

        Output: Five 3D protein structures (assessing confident regions with pLDDT > 80).

        b.Structure Optimization:

        Loop regions were optimized using Modeller.

        Energy minimization was performed using AmberTools.

     ^Molecular Binding Efficiency Analysis^

        a.Inputs:

        Crystal structure of the BoNT/A light chain.

        Predicted structures of the SNAP-25 mutants.

        b.Tool:

        ClusPro 2.0, which performs rigid-body docking based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm.

        c.Docking Process:

        ClusPro 2.0 first generates 70,000 different rotations of the ligand (e.g., SNAP-25 mutant). For each rotation, it performs translations along the x, y, and z axes relative to the receptor (e.g., BoNT/A light chain crystal structure), selecting the best-scoring translational combination for that rotation. From the 70,000 initial combinations, the 1,000 with the lowest scores are selected. These 1,000 conformations are then subjected to a greedy clustering analysis with a 9 Å C-alpha RMSD radius to identify the most likely binding poses.

        d.Docking Result:

        The output from ClusPro 2.0 typically consists of 1,000 low-energy results, which are clustered to find the native binding site with the widest free energy funnels. Results are presented in various formats, including the docked complex structures and scores for each model.

![Figure 1.3 Docking results of BoNT/A with SNAP-25 variants.](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/snap-25.webp)

        Figure 1.3: Docking results of BoNT/A with SNAP-25 variants. 1: Wild-type protein. 2: Deletion of residue 202. 3: Deletion of 201-202. 4: Deletion of 200-202. 5: Deletion of 199-202. A lower score indicates higher potential cleavage efficiency.

![Figure 1.4 Docking results of cleavage products with Ste2 receptor.](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/ste2.webp)

        Figure 1.4: Labels correspond to the variants in Figure 2. These are the docking results of the different cleavage products with the Ste2 receptor protein. A lower score indicates stronger binding affinity. 6 is the control group, measuring the binding affinity between alpha-factor and the Ste2 receptor.

    ^Results and Validation (Revised Method)^

        To obtain a more robust and physically meaningful metric for binding affinity, the initial approach of using a simple weighted average has been replaced with a method based on statistical mechanics. This approach correctly accounts for the contributions of all significant binding modes (clusters) based on their energy and population size.

    ^Boltzmann-Weighted Score (BWS)^

        Instead of a simple composite score, a Boltzmann-Weighted Score (BWS) is calculated for each construct. This score aggregates the contributions of all docked clusters, giving more weight to lower-energy and more populated clusters, which is physically more representative of the overall binding propensity.  

        The formula is:

        \[BWS = \sum_{i} \left( N_i × e^{-E_i / kT} \right)\] 

        Parameter Definitions:

        *i*: An index for each cluster generated by ClusPro for a given construct.

        *N_i*: The number of members (population) in cluster i. This reflects the size of the conformational basin for that binding mode.

        *E_i*: The representative energy score of cluster i. It is recommended to use the cluster's Center score, as it is a better representation of the cluster's average energy and is less sensitive to single outliers than the Lowest_Energy score.


        *kT*: The thermal energy term. For ranking purposes with docking scores, kT can be effectively set to 1. This simplifies the calculation while preserving the crucial exponential relationship between energy and probability, ensuring that lower-energy states are weighted more heavily.

        ^Relative Binding Efficiency (RBE)^

        Using the BWS, a direct and meaningful Relative Binding Efficiency (RBE) can be calculated. This ratio reflects how the overall binding propensity of a construct compares to a reference.   

        The formula is:   

        \[\text{RBE}_{\text{construct}} = \left( \frac{\text{BWS}_{\text{construct}}}{\text{BWS}_{\text{reference}}} \right) × 100\%\]

        Parameter Definitions:

        *BWS_construct*: The Boltzmann-Weighted Score calculated for the construct of interest.

        *BWS_reference*: The BWS of the baseline construct (e.g., the Control α-factor or the wild-type SNAP25 partial). This sets the 100% reference point for comparison.

        This revised methodology provides a more accurate and scientifically defensible ranking of the constructs' binding affinities.


# 1.4 Modeling the Dynamic Cleavage and Product Release Process

Enzymatic cleavage is inherently a dynamic event. Standard static docking is insufficient as it only captures the initial binding pose and cannot model the subsequent transition state, bond scission, and product release. To address this, a more sophisticated multi-step simulation approach is necessary to effectively model the process and estimate cleavage efficiency.

^Defining the Post-Cleavage State^

    The first step is to accurately represent the system immediately after the peptide bond is broken.

^Key Operations^

    Substrate Cleavage Site Definition:

    Based on the experimentally confirmed BoNT/A cleavage site (Q197-R198 of SNAP-25), the substrate structure is computationally modified to generate two distinct product fragments (an N-terminal and a C-terminal peptide). Instead of an abrupt covalent break, a more physically realistic approach is used, employing the nmropt function in AMBER to gradually weaken the force constant of the target peptide bond, simulating a bond-softening and dissociation pathway.

^Modeling the Enzyme-Product Complex with Flexible Docking^

    The interaction between the enzyme and the two newly formed product fragments is then modeled to understand the product release energetics.

^Key Steps^

        a.Docking Software:

        HADDOCK 2.4 is an excellent choice, selected for its strength in handling multi-body systems and its ability to incorporate data-driven restraints.

        b.Flexible Region Definition: 
        
        To account for the conformational rearrangements that occur upon cleavage and during product release, crucial regions must be defined as flexible. These include:

            The catalytic active site of the BoNT/A light chain (LC).

            The residues surrounding the newly formed C- and N-termini of the two SNAP-25 product fragments.

        c.Application of Restraints:
        
        To guide the simulation towards a realistic dissociated state, distance restraints can be applied.

        An ambiguous restraint ensuring the catalytic residues of BoNT/A remain proximal to the cleavage site.

        A negative restraint (e.g., distance > 8 Å) between the new C-terminus (of the first fragment) and N-terminus (of the second fragment) can be used to model their separation and prevent unrealistic re-ligation.

    ^Conformational Sampling and Selection:^
    
        A large ensemble of complex conformations (e.g., 1,000) is generated.

        These are scored and ranked (e.g., using the HADDOCK score), and the top-ranking models are selected.

        Cluster analysis (e.g., based on RMSD with a threshold of 5.0 Å) is performed to identify the most representative and populated conformational states of the enzyme-product complex.  

    ^Results and Interpretation (Post-Simulation Analysis)^

        The energy landscapes derived from these more advanced simulations, often represented by calculating the activation energy barriers for product release (as conceptualized in Figure 6), provide a more direct and physically relevant proxy for cleavage efficiency than simple binding scores. By comparing these energy barriers across different mutants, a robust ranking of their relative cleavage efficiencies can be established. Based on a comprehensive analysis, the 199-202Δ mutant can be identified as the most suitable candidate among the tested proteins.

 # 1.5 Conclusion

This study aimed to identify an optimal SNAP-25 mutant by evaluating both its cleavage efficiency by the BoNT/A light chain and the subsequent binding affinity of its product to the Ste2 receptor. Faced with a lack of experimental kinetic data, we developed a comprehensive in silico workflow combining structure prediction, multi-stage molecular docking, and a physically-grounded scoring methodology based on Boltzmann statistics.

Our integrated analysis consistently identifies the SNAP-25 partialΔ199-202 mutant as the most promising candidate. This conclusion is supported by two key findings:

^Enhanced Cleavage Efficiency^: 
    
Dynamic modeling of the product release process indicated that the Δ199-202 mutant possesses the lowest activation energy barrier, suggesting a faster and more efficient catalytic turnover.

^Favorable Downstream Binding^:
    
The cleavage product of this mutant maintained a strong binding affinity for the Ste2 receptor, ensuring that its subsequent biological function is not compromised.

The findings provide a strong, data-driven rationale for prioritizing the Δ199-202 mutant for experimental validation. Furthermore, the computational pipeline established here serves as a robust framework for similar enzyme engineering and substrate optimization problems, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. Future work should focus on experimentally verifying these predictions through in vitro assays.

# 2. Molecular dynamics simulation between Ste 2 and the fusion protein

Our biosensor relies on the binding of the α-factor released after toxin cleavage to the Ste2 receptor. However, unexpected detachment or anchoring failure of Pir1p on the yeast cell wall could cause the Pir1p-SNAP25-α-factor fusion protein to disperse into the environment and accidentally bind to the Ste2 receptor, leading to false positive signals. 

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only allows us to directly observe the behavior of the full-length fusion protein and the Ste2 receptor, but also provides reliable quantitative data to verify the biosensor's reliability. Therefore, we conducted MD simulations and performed a detailed analysis of the output data. Through simulations over 100 nanoseconds, we confirmed that the C-terminal α-factor of the fusion protein is unlikely to bind to the Ste2 receptor, reducing the likelihood of such false positive signals.

Additionally, our team has provided a quick guide to molecular dynamics simulation, making this tool more accessible and user-friendly.


# 2.1 Preparation for operation: Software environment and hardware equipment

We chose to use Gromacs as the simulation tool and Pymol as the visualization tool. All molecular dynamics simulations were performed on a high-performance workstation running Ubuntu 20.04.6 LTS, equipped with an Intel Core i9-14900KF CPU (24 cores/32 threads) and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU (12GB VRAM). This configuration provided substantial parallel processing capabilities through 32 available CPU threads and GPU acceleration via CUDA 12.8, enabling efficient execution of our 100 ns production simulations using GROMACS with full hardware optimization.

# 2.2 System Setup: Molecular Model Construction and Force Field Selection

The foundation of MD simulations is the molecular data and force field configuration of the research subject. In terms of the construction of the research subject, we obtained three structures:

![Protein structures displayed by
PyMol](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/molecular.webp)

From left to right: the Pir1p-SNAP25-α-factor fusion protein (predicted by Alphafold2), the α-factor-bound Ste2 (PDB:7QA8), and the ligand-free
Ste2 (PDB:7QB9).

For the force field and other configurations, we chose the CHARMM36 force field, and for the solution box, we selected the SPCE water box.

``` bash
align fusion and chain A, receptor_ref  
select alpha_linker , fusion and resi 407-414
save initial_complex.pdb, fusion
gmx pdb2gmx -f initial_complex.pdb -o processed.gro -p topol.top -water spce -ff charmm36 -ignh  
```

Our aim is to verify whether, in solution, the α-factor detached from the C-terminus of the fusion protein could bind unintentionally to Ste2, thereby generating false positive signals and interfering with toxin detection. We aligned the spatial position of the fusion protein(fusion) with the extracellular region of the receptor (receptor_ref) to facilitate subsequent simulation of their binding conformation.

# 2.3 Build a balanced simulation system: Energy Minimization and NVT & NPT Equilibration

Energy minimization is the primary step in molecular dynamics simulations, with its core purpose being to eliminate atomic overlaps and geometric conflicts in the initial model. By optimizing atomic positions, it relaxes the system to a lower-energy, stable state, thereby removing unreasonable internal stresses and providing a physically reasonable starting point for subsequent equilibration and production simulations, ensuring numerical stability and reliability of the results.

```bash
# Define a simulation box
gmx editconf -f processed.gro -o newbox.gro -c -d 1.0 -bt cubic
# Solvation
gmx solvate -cp newbox.gro -cs spc216.gro -o solvated.gro -p topol.top
# Add particles to physiological concentration
gmx grompp -f ions.mdp -c solvated.gro -p topol.top -o ions.tpr
gmx genion -s ions.tpr -o ionized.gro -p topol.top -pname NA -nname CL -neutral -conc 0.15
# Using the steepest descent method, the energy is converged to a minimum.
gmx grompp -f minim.mdp -c ionized.gro -p topol.top -o em.tpr 
gmx mdrun -v -deffnm em -nt 1
```

After completing the energy minimization step, the potential energy decreased from the initial -4,447,399.50 kJ/mol to the final -13,915,840.00 kJ/mol, a drop of 212.9%.

![Figure 2.2 Energy Mnimization](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/energy-minimization-validation.webp)

After completing energy minimization, allow the system to relax under the set temperature and pressure to reach a stable dynamic equilibrium that corresponds to real experimental conditions (such as specific temperature, pressure, and density), preparing the system for production simulation. This work is divided into two consecutive stages: NVT equilibration (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) and NPT equilibration (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature). During this process, positional restraints are applied to the protein atoms.

a. NVT equilibrium, also known as isothermal equilibrium, aims to assign the correct temperature (kinetic energy distribution) to the system. Starting from the 'cold' system (0 K) obtained from energy minimization, the temperature of the system is gradually increased and stabilized at our target temperature of 310 K (37°C, physiological temperature) within 100 ps using a thermostat (we use V-rescale). During this phase, the system volume is fixed, which means the system density will adjust itself as the temperature rises.

```bash
gmx grompp -f nvt.mdp -c em.gro -r em.gro -p topol.top -o nvt.tpr
gmx mdrun -deffnm nvt -v -nt 2
```

After the NVT equilibration, we obtained a system with the correct temperature but the density may not yet be at the target value.

b. NPT equilibration, also known as isothermal-isobaric equilibration, aims to adjust the system density to the correct value by controlling the pressure. Based on the NVT stage, we maintain the temperature at 310 K. At the same time, we use the Parrinello-Rahman method to enable pressure coupling, keeping the system pressure stable at 1 bar (standard atmospheric pressure). The simulation box can then fluctuate in volume. The pressure coupler will adjust the box size to bring the internal pressure of the system to the target value, allowing the density of water molecules and ions to reach approximately that of real water, ~1000 kg/m³. In this stage, we do not regenerate velocities, but continue using the velocities from the NVT stage, allowing a smooth transition from NVT to NPT.

```bash
gmx grompp -f npt.mdp -c nvt.gro -r nvt.gro -t nvt.cpt -p topol.top -o npt.tpr
gmx mdrun -deffnm npt -v -nt 2
```

![Figure 2.3 NVT & NPT](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/nvt-npt-equilibration-validation.webp)

After the NPT equilibration, we obtained a system with correct temperature, pressure, and density, and the solvent molecules had formed a stable environment around the protein.

# 2.4 Production simulation and data analysis

Based on our molecular dynamics work, we performed a 100-ns production simulation to study the dynamic behavior of the fusion protein and its interaction with the Ste2 receptor. The simulation was carried out using GROMACS under the CHARMM36 force field, with a 2-fs time step under NPT ensemble conditions at 310 K and 1.0 bar. The simulation aimed to observe whether structural fluctuations in the uncut fusion protein would lead to unintended binding—a key question for assessing potential false positives in our biosensor system. The detailed parameter table of our simulation is as follows.

This simulation used GPU acceleration with assistance from a 16-core CPU, and the runtime was 46 hours.

```

We conducted the following analysis on the obtained 100 ns simulation results:

a. By directly visualizing the trajectories from the production phase in PyMOL, we observed that the α-factor (located at the distal end of the long α-helix of the fusion protein) never approaches the binding pocket of Ste2.

![Figure 2.4 visualization](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/movie-final.webp)

(the fusion protein and the ste2 were painted cyan)


b. Turning radius analysis

Radius of gyration analysis can confirm the conformational stability of fusion proteins from the perspective of structural dynamics, providing key molecular-level evidence for the low false-positive risk of biosensors.

```bash
gmx gyrate -s md_5ns.tpr -f md_5ns.xtc -o gyrate.xvg
```

Based on a systematic analysis of a 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation trajectory, the calculation of the radius of gyration revealed that the fusion protein maintains a stable spatial conformation in solution, with an average size of 3.86 nm and relatively small fluctuations (approximately 4.6% relative fluctuation). This indicates that the protein structure is well-packed, without significant folding or extension, further supporting from a structural dynamics perspective that it can effectively avoid unintended interactions with the Ste2 receptor in its intact state, providing key theoretical guidance for designing low false-positive biosensors.

![Figure 2.5 Turing radius analysis](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/comprehensive-radius-of-gyration-analysis.webp)

From Table A, it can be seen that the average radius of gyration is 3.856 nm, with a fluctuation range of 3.482 - 4.140 nm (±0.334 nm), a standard deviation of 0.176 nm, and a relative fluctuation of 4.6%. A relative fluctuation of 4.6% indicates that the conformational changes of the fusion protein are within an acceptable range, and the protein maintains a relatively stable tertiary structure. The size of the fusion protein, 3.86 nm, is suitable for display on the cell surface, being neither too compact (which could affect function) nor excessively extended (which could lead to degradation).

As seen in Table B, the radius of gyration in the X direction is 2.355 nm (most compact), in the Y direction is 3.590 nm (most extended), and in the Z direction is 3.357 nm (moderate), with an anisotropy of 1.235 nm. The Y-direction is 52% longer than the X-direction, indicating that the protein is ellipsoidal in shape. This shape is conducive to the exertion of steric effects. Anisotropic shapes can more effectively isolate the α factor, form asymmetric structures, and reduce the probability of accidental contact with the Ste2 receptor.


c. RMSD
We calculated the RMSD of the protein backbone atoms to assess whether the system had reached a stable state during the production simulation.

```bash
gmx rms -s md.tpr -f md.xtc -o rmsd.xvg -tu ns
```

RMSD analysis indicates that the fusion protein remains structurally stable and convergent during the 100 ns simulation, providing key dynamic evidence to confirm that its spatial conformation does not lead to false-positive binding.

![Figure 2.6 RMSD](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/rmsd-plot-scaled.webp)

The average RMSD was 0.65 ± 0.25 nm, with a fluctuation range of 0.40 - 1.35 nm. The system reached a stable equilibrium after approximately 40 ns. The RMSD values remained below 1.0 nm, indicating that the fusion protein maintained an intact folded structure. There were no drastic conformational changes, supporting the structural reliability of the sensor.


# 2.5 Discussion

Through 100-nanosecond all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we verified that the fusion protein can effectively maintain its structural integrity in the uncleaved state, while the α-factor and the Ste2 receptor remain stably spatially separated, indicating that the theoretical risk of false positives due to anchoring failure or detachment is very low. Although molecular dynamics simulations provide valuable theoretical insights for sensor design, it is important to note a significant limitation: the simulations did not include the cellular membrane environment of the Ste2 receptor. In the interaction images obtained from our simulations, part of the fusion protein interacts with the transmembrane region of Ste2, which clearly does not reflect the true protein-protein interaction. Therefore, such potential false positives still require further optimization of simulation conditions or validation through wet-lab experiments.

# 3. ODE for simulation of the fusion protein gene expression and shedding

# 3.1 Abstract

We established a system of ordinary differential equations to quantitatively simulate and analyze the expression of the fusion protein Pir1P-SNAP25-α factor in Substrate-acting Strain, its loss during lyophilization, and its dynamic changes upon rehydration. The results indicated that yeast cells rapidly returned to steady-state expression after rehydration, with the number of cell wall–anchored fusion proteins remaining relatively stable, while the proportion of spontaneously detached proteins consistently low. Therefore, we conclude that the spontaneous detachment of the fusion protein has a negligible effect on the accuracy of botulinum toxin detection, ensuring the reliability of the assay system.

# 3.2 Introduction

In our project, the fusion protein gene was stably integrated into the the genome of the substrate-acting strain to enable continuous expression. The substrate-acting strain is further intended to be preserved by lyophilization, formulated as ready-to-use product, and rehydrated before detection. Based on this workflow, gene expression modeling of the substrate-acting strain was divided into three stages: cultivation, lyophilization, and rehydration.

# 3.3 Cultivation Stage

To produce our product,the substrate-acting strain with the integrated fusion protein gene was continuously cultured for an extended period before lyophilization. During this cultivation stage, the expression of the fusion protein proceeds sequentially through transcription, translation, protein processing, and secretion and anchoring (as illustrated in Fig. 1) [1,2].

![Figure 3.1 The process of fusion protein Pir1P-SNAP25-α factor expression and anchoring](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/gene-expression-flowchart.webp)

1) Transcription: 

\[
\frac{dM}{dt} = k_{\text{tx}} - (k_{M,\text{deg}} + k_{\text{dil}}) · M
\]

2) Translation (mRNA is translated into nascent, immature polypeptide chains):

\[
\frac{dP_{\text{immature}}}{dt} = k_{\text{tl}} · M - (k_{\text{mature}} + k_{\text{Pc,deg1}} + k_{\text{dil}}) · P_{\text{immature}}
\]

3) Protein Processing (immature peptides mature through folding and post-translational modifications):

\[
\frac{dP_{\text{mature}}}{dt} = k_{\text{mature}} · P_{\text{immature}} - (k_{\text{wall}} + k_{\text{Pc,deg2}} + k_{\text{dil}}) · P_{\text{mature}}
\]

4) Secretion & Anchoring (mature fusion proteins are released into the periplasmic space of yeast and covalently anchored to the yeast cell wall):

\[
\frac{dP_{\text{wall}}}{dt} = k_{\text{wall}} · P_{\text{mature}} - (k_{\text{free}} + k_{\text{dil}}) · P_{\text{wall}}
\]

5) Spontaneous Release (A small proportion of fusion proteins are spontaneously released from the cell wall):

\[
\frac{dP_{\text{free}}}{dt} = k_{\text{free}} · P_{\text{wall}}
\]

The simulation process throughout the cultivation stage is shown in Fig. 2.

![Figure 3.2 Cultivation Stage](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/cultivation-stage.webp)

Because the cultivation period is sufficiently long, the gene expression process reaches steady state prior to lyophilization. $M$,$P_{\text{immature}}$,$P_{\text{mature}}$,$P_{\text{wall}}$,$P_{\text{free}}$,etc.,are constants,and therefore we define:

1) Transcription
\[
    \frac{dM}{dt} = 0
\]
2) Translation(mRNA translation into nascent, immature polypeptide chains):
\[
    \frac{dP_{immature}}{dt} = 0
\]
3) Protein Processing(Maturation of immature peptides through folding and post-translational modifications):
\[
    \frac{dP_{mature}}{dt} = 0
\]
4) Secretion & Anchoring(Release of the mature fusion protein into the periplasmic space of yeast, followed by covalent anchoring to the yeast cell wall):
\[
    \frac{dP_{wall}}{dt} = 0
\]

At steady state, the molecular abundances were calculated as:

\[
    M = 6.9 molecules/cell
\]
\[
    P_{immature} = 56.3 molecules/cell
\]
\[
    P_{mature} = 54.5 molecules/cell
\]
\[
    P_{wall} = 950.8 molecules/cell
\]

In the cultivation stage, we assumed that once secreted into the periplasmic space of yeast, PIR-fusion proteins were immediately anchored to the cell wall, thereby neglecting any time delay in anchoring. This assumption is justified since PIR proteins can rapidly undergo covalent attachment to the yeast cell wall under the action of specific enzymes [3], and no reliable experimental data for anchoring kinetics are currently available.

# 3.4 Lyophilization Stage

During lyophilization, multiple biomolecules within and outside yeast cells inevitably suffer structural and functional damage. This may result from low-temperature stress, ice crystal formation, conformational changes induced by desiccation, and reduced efficiency of recovery during rehydration [4,5]. To incorporate these effects into the model, loss parameters were introduced to account for the stability of different biomolecular species:

mRNA ($M$):prone to chemical degradation and structural cleavage; loss constant $k_1$[6].

Immature polypeptides: ($P_{\text{immature}}$):unstable due to incomplete folding and modification; susceptible to aggregation or degradation; loss constant $k_2$

Mature proteins ($P_{\text{mature}}$):relatively stable but still subject to conformational changes and partial denaturation; loss constant $k_3$[7].

Cell-wall-anchored proteins ($P_{\text{free}}$):anchoring enhances stability, but cell wall structure may be disrupted by freeze-drying stress [8]; loss constant $k_4$

Thus, the initial values for the rehydration stage were defined as:
\[
    M_0 = (1 - k_1) · M
\]
\[
    P_{immature,0} = (1 - k_2) · P_{immature}
\]
\[
    P_{mature,0} = (1 - k_3) · P_{mature}
\]
\[
    P_{wall,0} = (1 - k_4) · P_{wall}
\]

Estimated parameter values: $k_1$ = 0.2,$k_2$ = 0.25,$k_3$ = 0.1,$k_4$ = 0.05

|Parameter          |Meaning                                                      |
|:------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
|$M_0$            |Amount of fusion protein mRNA after lyophilization          |
|$P_{immature}$ |Amount of immature peptide chains after lyophilization      |
|$P_{mature}$   |Amount of mature proteins after lyophilization              |
|$P_{wall}$     |Amount of fusion proteins anchored on the cell wall after lyophilization |
|$k_1$            |Loss constant of fusion protein mRNA during lyophilization  |
|$k_2$            |Loss constant of immature peptide chains during lyophilization |
|$k_3$            |Loss constant of mature proteins during lyophilization      |
|$k_4$            |Loss constant of cell wall-anchored proteins during lyophilization |

Since no direct experimental data are available for biomolecular damage during yeast lyophilization, these constants were estimated based on molecular stability and possible damage pathways. The use of cryoprotectants further reduces molecular loss, and therefore some biomolecules may remain largely intact. Moreover, fusion proteins spontaneously released into the medium prior to freezexdrying were excluded from consideration, yielding an initial $P_{\text{free}}$ = 0 at the rehydration stage [8].

# 3.5 Rehydration Stage

During rehydration, yeast cells were assumed to rapidly regain physiological activity following reconstitution [9]. Therefore, the same system of differential equations used for the cultivation stage was applied, except that the initial values corresponded to the post-lyophilization abundances.

The gene expression during the recovery phase is shown in Fig. 3.
![Figure 3.3](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/resuscitation-stage.webp)

The simulation results indicate that substrate-acting strain cells restored steady-state expression levels within a short period. Throughout the rehydration phase, the number of cell-wall-anchored fusion proteins remained high, whereas the abundance of spontaneously released proteins was consistently low. These findings confirm that lyophilized yeast can be successfully reactivated for botulinum toxin detection and further validate that spontaneous release of the fusion protein does not significantly compromise detection accuracy.

# 3.6  Discussion

In this study, most parameter values were obtained from published literature. Although discrepancies with actual experimental conditions may exist due to environmental variability, the overall qualitative trends align well with biological expectations.
Two core assumptions underlie the modeling framework:

1) We assumed immediate anchoring of fusion proteins upon secretion into the periplasmic space. This simplification effectively neglects anchoring delay, which is justified given the lack of reliable anchoring rate measurements and the strong enzymatic propensity of PIR proteins to covalently attach to the cell wall.

2) We neglected the transient lag in physiological recovery during rehydration. Although in reality yeast does not immediately regain full activity, rehydrated dry yeast has been shown to recover rapidly in suitable media. Therefore, this assumption does not substantially affect the modeled dynamics.

Although several parameters were estimated rather than experimentally measured, all estimations were made within biologically reasonable ranges and do not alter the qualitative conclusions. Overall, this modeling study provides a quantitative framework for analyzing the complete workflow of substrate strain production, preservation, and application.

# 4.The entire process simulation of the project: the corresponding relationship between botulinum toxin concentration and signal strength

# 4.1. Motivation

In this project, we aim to design a botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT/A) biosensor based on the chassis organism *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*. Utilizing BoNT/A's cleavage activity on SNAP25, the cascade amplification of the MATα mating type's MAPK signaling pathway in response to α-factor, and the downstream product MjDOD catalyzing a reaction to produce the final colored product betaxanthin (yellow), we hope to achieve a sensitive and intuitive portable detection method for BoNT/A.

However, the following key issues cannot be resolved by experiments alone:

a.Since our laboratory cannot directly use BoNT/A as an experimental substance, how will we ultimately determine the relationship between BoNT/A concentration and the final signal?

b.Due to the inherent complexity of biological systems and the relative scarcity of high-quality data, there is significant uncertainty in model parameters. Although parameter optimization cannot be performed before obtaining rigorous experimental data, how can we understand the impact of different parameters on the prediction results to minimize errors?

c.The Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantification (LOQ) are crucial attributes of a biosensor and key differentiators for its precision. However, since our team cannot obtain BoNT/A, how can we determine the designed LOD and LOQ?

To address these problems, as a substitute for real experiments, to derive the complete BoNT/A–signal relationship, calculate the LOD and LOQ, attempt to compare them with the detection thresholds of the human eye and micro-spectrophotometers, and better guide subsequent design to avoid blind screening of experimental conditions, we have established a mathematical model.

# 4.2 Overview

![Figure 4.1 ](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/graph-demo-2.webp)

Our model is primarily divided into three parts: Plotting the BoNT/A–signal dose-response curve, Stochastic process simulation and calculation of LOD/LOQ, and Parameter sensitivity analysis. The latter two are analyses of the former's predictions and are described in detail elsewhere. The former, "BoNT/A–signal dose-response curve plotting," directly involves the entire pathway and is relatively complex; therefore, we provide a detailed analysis here:

^a.^ Two types of *S. cerevisiae*, the upstream strain (Substrate-acting strain) and the downstream strain (Signal-transferring Strain), are co-cultured in liquid medium, competing until they reach equilibrium and the total concentration stabilizes. The upstream strain expresses a fusion protein of SNAP25 C-terminally fused to α-factor on its surface, while the downstream strain has the natural α-factor receptor Ste2 on its surface.

^b.^ We engineered the MAPK signaling pathway in the upstream strain: knocking out the *ste12*, *gal4*, *gal80*, and *far1* genes (*ste12Δ, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, far1Δ*), and expressing a synthetic fusion protein, sTF, inside the cell.

^c.^ Binding of α-factor to the Ste2 receptor activates this signaling pathway. The downstream Fus3 protein in the pathway can interact with the exogenous fusion protein sTF. sTF is a fusion protein with a *Ste12PRD* at one end and a *Gal4DBD* at the other end. Fus3 protein activates sTF, which then, via *Gal4DBD*, activates the *pGAL1* promoter in the cell. We knocked out the endogenous *GAL1* gene and integrated the gene for *DODA* (4,5-dopa dioxygenase) from *Mirabilis jalapa* (*MjDOD*) downstream of the *pGAL1* promoter into the yeast nuclear genome. We expect that after the Fus3 protein activates the *pGAL1* promoter, it will activate Gal4DBD and successfully express the MjDOD protein.

^d.^ At the start of detection, we add the sample to be tested, which may contain trace amounts of BoNT/A, to the culture medium in the detection kit. In a theoretical laboratory validation, we would add a quantified amount of BoNT/A to the medium. It exerts its protease activity, cleaving the SNAP25 part of the fusion protein and releasing the α-factor. The α-factor diffuses and binds to the Ste2 receptors on the surface of MATα yeast, transmitting the signal downstream via the MAPK signaling pathway, initiating downstream signaling and metabolic pathways, leading to the synthesis of MjDOD. Simultaneously, the α-factor and Ste2 receptors are internalized and degraded.

^e.^ Concurrently, we add a certain amount of L-DOPA to the medium. MjDOD, acting as a dopa dioxygenase, catalyzes the conversion of intracellular L-DOPA into betalamic acid. Betalamic acid then spontaneously reacts with various amino acids in the medium to generate different betaxanthins.

^f.^ One method of laboratory validation involves using a spectrophotometer to measure absorbance and calculating the betaxanthin concentration according to the Beer-Lambert law. By detecting the dose-response relationship between the added BoNT/A concentration and the final signal at different time points, the performance of the biosensor is ultimately validated.

# 4.3 Modeling Objective & Approach

We constructed a mathematical model primarily based on Delay Differential Equations (DDEs) to simulate the entire process from BoNT/A cleavage of the fusion protein to the final light absorption by betaxanthins.

We introduced delay times for steps that clearly take significant time, such as signal transduction and mRNA nuclear retention. We considered background noise and measurement errors, and introduced Gaussian random noise at key steps for Monte Carlo simulations, striving to enhance the simulation's credibility under the challenging condition of limited reference data.

Our model aims to achieve at least the following objectives:

    ^a.^ Derive the relationship curve between the betaxanthin signal intensity and experimental time, initial BoNT/A concentration, and the initial ratio of the two yeast strains.

    ^b.^ Calculate the LOD and LOQ of this biosensor and provide the variation of LOD and LOQ under different conditions.

After establishing the basic model framework, we initiated a new "Design-Build-Test-Learn" cycle to improve the model's predictive accuracy, achieving the following objectives:

    ^a.^ Evaluate the optimal yeast ratio at the beginning of the plateau phase to predict the best initial yeast ratio and optimize culture conditions.

    ^b.^ Evaluate the parameter sensitivity of the prediction results to provide a basis for further parameter adjustment.

    ^c.^To build  an easily-used interactive computational platform for modeling, simulating, and analyzing the limit of detection in biological signaling pathways without writing any code.

We used ^optimization algorithms^ to scan different concentration ratios of the upstream and downstream strains, striving to find the initial ratio that minimizes the LOD and maximizes the signal. We designed our own algorithm to evaluate the sensitivity of the model predictions to each parameter individually and used the ^Sobol index method^ to perform a global sensitivity analysis of the model parameters.

After establishing the model, we concurrently conducted further research. Noting the similarities between our algorithm and existing modeling software like ^COPASI^ , but considering COPASI's shortcomings such as high learning curve, relative complexity, poor cross-platform compatibility, limited customizability, and complex visualization and interaction experience, and also to promote the dissemination of results within the team and to external audiences, and to facilitate quick and intuitive presentation of product effects to users, we also endeavored to build ^a web platform^. This platform not only serves as a display for the model but, due to its ability to flexibly add/remove nodes and edges (interactions), holds promise to fill the gap as a learning and rapid experimental platform for future teams modeling biological systems.

# 4.4 Assumptions

^Homogeneity^: 

Except where replaced by delay times, the intracellular and extracellular environments are well-mixed systems without spatial gradients.

^Stability^: 

Within the simulation time scale, the concentration and enzymatic activity of BoNT/A remain constant. Yeast cell growth has entered the stationary phase, the total concentration remains constant, and various states are relatively stable.

^Partial Quasi-Steady State^: 

The binding of α-factor and the Ste2 receptor is assumed to be in a quasi-steady state, maintaining binding and dissociation equilibrium instantaneously.

^Limited Determinism/Uncertainty^: 

Biological systems are highly complex, and the parameters used for modeling themselves have significant uncertainty, thus it is necessary to introduce randomness. However, due to the excessive uncertainty inherent in biological systems, performing uncertainty modeling for every process is too workload-intensive. To minimize model complexity, we only perform uncertainty modeling for the most critical processes like signal transduction, transcription, and translation, and make deterministic assumptions for other processes with lower uncertainty.

^Limited Spatial-Temporal Delay^:

Since biological reactions always occur asynchronously and potentially in different locations, but to simplify the model as much as possible, we assume that significant time delay effects due to diffusion etc., exist only for key processes like α-factor diffusion, signal transduction, and mRNA nuclear retention/export. For other processes, reactions are assumed to be synchronous. Delay effects in other processes are neglected.

^Stable System Assumption^: 

Effects of environmental fluctuations such as temperature and pH, other than changes in the concentrations of some medium components, on the model are not considered.

^Neglect of Secondary Processes and Factors^: 

Enzymatic reactions follow ^Michaelis-Menten kinetics^ , without cooperative effects or product inhibition.

The absorbance of betalamic acid, L-DOPA, etc., at λ = 480nm is neglected. (This assumption is acceptable based on our experimental data; the absorbance of blank medium with experimental concentrations of L-DOPA is very low (Abs ≈ 0.01), and betalamic acid has low absorbance at λ = 480nm. In the absence of more detailed real data, this assumption is acceptable).

Due to lack of data, differences in the binding of various amino acids to betalamic acid are ignored, and amino acids are treated as an "average amino acid." 

Due to the strong affinity between L-DOPA and MjDOD, which greatly exceeds non-catalytic collisions between L-DOPA and betalamic acid, the binding of L-DOPA and betalamic acid is neglected. The binding of substances other than amino acids with betalamic acid is neglected.

Ignore the differences in binding characteristics with the Ste2 receptor between the α-factor with a tail after the fusion protein is cleaved and the wild-type α-factor.

The detection limit and quantification limit only take into account the properties of the system itself, temporarily ignoring the influence of other factors.

\[
\begin{cases}
inflow\_rate\_alphafactor  = \frac{k_{cat_{bonta}}*c_{snap25}}{K_{m_{bonta}}+c_{snap25}}*c_{bonta}*c_{snap25}\\
outflow\_rate\_alphafactor = - c_{\alpha-factor-free}*\frac{\ln2}{t_{0.5-\alpha factor}}\\
\frac{dc_{\alpha-factor-free}}{dt} = inflow\_rate\_alphafactor \ +\  outflow\_rate\_alphafactor\\
\frac{dc_{snap25}}{dt} = -\frac{k_{cat_{bonta}}*c_{snap25}}{K_{m_{bonta}}+c_{snap25}}*c_{bonta}*c_{snap25}\\
\frac{c_{ste2-receptor}}{dt} = - c_{\alpha-factor-free}*\frac{\ln2}{t_{0.5-\alpha factor}}\\
\theta = \frac{c_{\alpha-factor-free}}{EC50_{ste2}+c_{\alpha-factor-free}}\\
u_{pGAL1}(t) = \theta(t - t_{delay-transduction})\\
\end{cases}
\]

\[
\begin{cases}
c_{snap25}(0) = c_{snap25-initial}\\
c_{ste2-receptor}(0) = c_{ste2-receptor-initial} \\
c_{\alpha-factor-free}(0) = c_{\alpha-factor-free-initial}\\
\end{cases}
\]

\[
\begin{cases}
c_{snap25-initial} = \frac{\frac{ration\_cell}{ration\_cell+1}*c_{cell}*n_{snap25}}{N_{A}}\\
c_{ste2-receptor-initial}=\frac{\frac{1}{ration\_cell+1}*c_{cell}*n_{ste2-receptor}}{N_{A}}\\
\end{cases}
\]

BoNT/A cleaves the SNAP25 part of the fusion protein on the surface of MATA-type yeast, releasing α-factor. The α-factor diffuses to the vicinity of MATα yeast, binds to the Ste2 receptor, and simultaneously, according to the concentration of α-factor bound to Ste2 receptors, influences the internalization and degradation of α-factor and receptors.

^b. $GAL1\ Promoter\ Driven\ mRNA\ Transcription \to MjDOD\ Protein\ Synthesis\ and\ Degradation$^

\[
\begin{cases}
k_{transcription-pGAL1} = k_{transcription-pGAL1-max}*u_{pGAL1}\\
inflow\_rate\_mjdod\_mrna= k_{transcription-pGAL1}\\
\frac{dc_{mjdod-mrna}}{dt}  = inflow\_rate\_mjdod\_mrna(t_{delay-transduction}<t\\
<t_{delay-transduction}+t_{delay-transcription-to-translation})
\end{cases}
\]

\[
c_{mjdod-mrna}(0) = c_{mjdod-mrna-initial}
\]

The transcription rate of the *pGAL1* promoter is calculated proportionally to its maximum transcription rate. Downstream MjDOD mRNA is transcribed at this rate.

\[
\begin{cases}
inflow\_rate\_mjdod\_protein(t) = k\_translation\_mjdod*c_{mjdod-mrna}\\
outflow\_rate\_mjdod\_protein(t) = - c_{mjdod-protein}*\frac{\ln2}{t_{0.5-mjdod-protein}}\\
\frac{dc_{mjdod-protein}}{dt} = inflow\_rate\_mjdod\_protein\ + \ outflow\_rate\_mjdod\_protein \\
outflow\_rate\_mjdod\_mrna = - c_{mjdod-mrna}*\frac{\ln2}{t_{0.5-mjdod-mrna}}\\
\frac{dc_{mjdod-mrna}}{dt} = inflow\_rate\_mjdod\_mrna \ +\ outflow\_rate\_mjdod\_mrna
\end{cases}
\]

After MjDOD mRNA enters the cytoplasm, it is translated to produce MjDOD protein. Both mRNA and protein begin degradation simultaneously.

^c. $MjDOD\ Catalysis \to Betaxanthin\ Color\ Development$^

\[
\begin{cases}\frac{dc_{ldopa}}{dt} = - \frac{k_{cat_{mjdod}}}{K_{m_{mjdod}}+c_{ldopa}}*c_{ldopa}*c_{mjdod-protein}
\\inflow\_rate\_betalamic\_acid = \frac{k_{cat_{mjdod}}}{K_{m_{mjdod}}+c_{ldopa}}*c_{ldopa}*c_{mjdod-protein}
\\degradation\_rate\_betaxanthins= - c_{betaxanthins}*\frac{\ln2}{t_{0.5-betaxanthins}}
\\\frac{dc_{aminoacids}}{dt} = outflow\_rate\_betalamic\_acid =  - k_{betalamicacid\_to\_betaxanthins}*c_{aminoacids}*c_{betalamic-acid}
\\\frac{dc_{betalamic-acid}}{dt} = inflow\_rate\_betalamic\_acid\ +\ outflow\_rate\_betalamic\_acid
\\\frac{dc_{betaxanthins}}{dt} = k_{betalamicacid\_to\_betaxanthins}*c_{aminoacids}*c_{betalamic-acid}\ +\ degradation\_rate\_betaxanthins
\end{cases}
\]

MjDOD catalyzes the conversion of L-DOPA to betalamic acid; betalamic acid then combines with amino acids inside the cell to generate (mixed) betaxanthins. Betaxanthins produce color and simultaneously undergo degradation.

^d.$Monte\ Carlo\ Method\ for\ Noise\ Simulation$^

\[
\begin{cases}
for\ final\  signal:
\\
\sigma_{final-signal} = A_{final}(t,c_{\alpha-factor}) · CV_{final-signal}
\\
for \ blank \ signal:
\\
\sigma_{blank-signal} = A_{blank}(t,c_{\alpha-factor}) · CV_{blank-signal}
\\assuming :u_1, u_2 are random number in (0,1) ,then:\\z_0 = \sqrt{-2 \ln u_1} · \cos(2\pi u_2)
\\{noise} = z_0 · \sigma + \mu
\end{cases}
\]

Method offered by numpy kit is used to simulate the random noise distribution of the final signal and background noise. Assuming it follows a normal distribution based on the characteristics of the biological system.

^e. $Limit \ of\  Detection\  (LOD) \ \& \  Limit\  of\  Quantification\  (LOQ) \ Calculation$^

\[
\begin{cases}
Threshold_{LOD}=μ_{blank} +3⋅σ_{blank}
\\ (SNR _{LOD}= \frac{S(c_{LOD})−μ_{blank}}{σ_{blank}}=3)
\\Threshold_{LOQ}=μ_{blank}+10⋅σ_{blank}
\\ (SNR _{LOQ}= \frac{S(c_{LOQ})−μ_{blank}}{σ_{blank}}=10)
\\c_{{LOD}} = f^{-1}\left( {Threshold}_{{LOD}} \right)
\\c_{{LOQ}} = f^{-1}\left( {Threshold}_{{LOQ}} \right)
\end{cases}
\]

Using local interpolation, obtain the inverse mapping $f^{-1}$ from BoNT/A concentration to signal, then calculate LOD and LOQ according to the IUPAC recommended method above.

^f. $Single\ Parameter\ Sensitivity\ Analysis$^

\[
\begin{cases}
S= \frac{ \  Relative\  Variation_{final-signal}}{\  Relative\ Change_{signal-parameter}}= \frac{\frac{Δy_{avg}}{y_{0}}}{\frac{Δp_{avg}}{p_{0}}}\\
Δy_{avg} = \frac{y_{+}-y_{-}}{2}\\
Δp_{avg} = \frac{p_{+}-p_{-}}{2}\\
\end{cases}
\]

The Sensitivity Coefficient $S$ represents the relative strength of the relationship between parameter change and output change. $S > 0$ indicates a positive correlation; $S < 0$ indicates a negative correlation; the larger $ |S|$ is, the more significant the parameter's influence on the output.

^g. $Global\  Sensitivity\  Analysis$^

The Sobol method, based on variance decomposition, quantifies the contribution of parameters and their interactions to the output variation. The formulas are as follows:

\[
\begin{cases}
V(Y) = \sum_{i=1}^n V_i + \sum_{1 \leq i<j \leq n} V_{ij} + \sum_{1 \leq i<j<k \leq n}V_{ijk} + \dots + V_{1,2,\dots,n} \\
S_1^{(i)} = \frac{V_i}{V(Y)}, \quad ST^{(i)} = \frac{V_i + \sum_{j \neq i} V_{ij} + \dots + V_{1,2,\dots,n}}{V(Y)}
\end{cases}
\]

$V(Y)$ represents the total variance of the output variable; $V_i$ represents the variance caused by parameter $i$ alone; $V_{ij}$ represents the variance caused by the interaction between parameters $i$ and $j$. The first-order index $S_{1_i}$ indicates the proportion of output variation contributed by parameter $i$ alone. Similarly, the total effect index $ST_i$ represents the total proportion of output variation contributed by parameter $i$ and its interactions with all other parameters.

Both $S_1$ and $ST$ are non-negative; a larger value indicates a more significant influence of the parameter (or including its interactions) on the output. $S_{T_i} - S_{1_i}$ reflects the strength of the interaction between parameter $i$ and other parameters.

\]

Since the total reaction time required is long (≈8h), it can be assumed that mRNA transcription initiation and elongation reach a quasi-steady state after a short period. Furthermore, the protein production rate per single mRNA is primarily determined by the mRNA-specific initiation rate, which dictates the frequency of new ribosomes starting translation. Once steady state is reached, the rate of ribosome completion equals the initiation rate.

Calculation of initiation rate:

The rate of protein production during translation is primarily determined by the process of ribosomes moving along the mRNA. Therefore:

\[
n_{ribo-per-script}=\frac{length_{mjdod-mrna-ORF}}{100}*{density_{ribo-per-kb}}\\
t_{initial-transaltion-gap-per protein}= \frac{length_{mjdod-mrna-ORF}}{3*rate_{ribo-elongation}*n_{ribo-per-script}}\\
rate_{mjdod-protein-synthesis-per-mrna} =\frac{60}{t_{initial-transaltion-gap-per protein}}
\]

$n_{ribo-per-script}$ refers to the number of ribosomes bound per open reading frame (ORF), determined by ORF length and a relatively constant ribosome "density". Let the ORF length be $length_{mjdod-mrna-ORF}$. Ribosome density is $density_{ribo-per-kb}$.

\[rate_{ribo-elongation} = 9\ {codons/(transcript·s)}[13]\]

ORF length:

\[length_{mjdod-mrna-ORF} = 3 · length_{mjdod-protein} + 3 = 267 · 3 + 3 = 804\ {nt}(Uniprot Dataset)\]

Average ribosome density:

\[density_{ribo-per-kb} = 0.64\ {ribosomes/100 nt}\]

^Annotations: Ribosome density is significantly negatively correlated with ORF length. Short ORFs (<400 nt): average density 1.2 / 100 nt; Long ORFs (>3600 nt): average density 0.14 / 100 nt.^[15]

Based on the above, the translation rate is calculated as:

\[
k\_translation\_mjdod = \frac{60}{\frac{804}{3*9*\frac{804*0.64}{100}}} =10.368\ protein/(mrna*s)
\]

In the severe lack of relevant data, we can only assume that the binding of L-DOPA and betalamic acid is similar to that of general amino acids with betalamic acid. The following facts and conclusions support our assumption:
    
L-DOPA, like general amino acids, is an amino-containing molecule. The reaction mechanism with betalamic acid involves spontaneous condensation to form an imine structure (Schiff base), ultimately generating betaxanthins.

Dots represent the median response times of the cell population, and lines represent the 25th and 75th percentiles.(Aymoz,2018)](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/max-expression-response-time-fig.webp)

$late: 30\ {min}$

Based on the relationship between average expression output and response time in the graph, the average response time, i.e., the signal transduction delay time, can be estimated as:

\[ t_{delay-transduction} ≈ 22.5\ {min} = 1350\ {s}\]

"Nuclear retention half-life" means: the time required for 50% of the nuclear mature mRNA population to complete their nuclear residence. The decrease in the number of mature RNAs in the nucleus is mainly due to export and degradation. For mRNAs of most cytoplasmic proteins, nuclear degradation is almost negligible. Therefore, the "nuclear retention half-life" can be considered as the median time for mRNA export from the nucleus. Thus, it is estimated:

\[t_{half\_out} = t_{delay-transcription-to-translation} = 78\ {min} = 4680\ {s}\]

In the CIELab color space, the $b*$ value specifically represents the yellow-blue color component. A positive $b*$ indicates a color similar to yellow, with a larger value indicating a more intense yellow hue; a negative $b*$ indicates a color to similar to blue, with a smaller value (larger absolute value) indicating a more intense blue hue.

Coincidentally, the absorption wavelength of various betaxanthins is about 480nm, corresponding to blue-green light, while the reflected light is just yellow. Furthermore, the literature reports processing each betaxanthin separately, implying single substances. Experimental data also shows that $L*$ and $a*$ change very little before and after treatment, while only $b*$ changes significantly. In summary, we can accept using the change in $b*$ chroma to approximate represent the concentration of betaxanthins.

Due to the special color change of L-Phe-Bx, we carefully examined the L*, a*, and b* of the other three betaxanthins before storage (BS) and after storage (AS) for 8 days (L-Leu-Bx for 4 days at $ pH$=4) at $pH$=4.0 and $pH$=6.0, respectively.

Observation readily shows that the half-lives of various betaxanthins are long, far exceeding the test time (8h). Therefore, the degradation of betaxanthins during the experiment can be ignored. Since our product is designed to operate in a near-neutral pH environment (pH≈6), it is reasonable to use the degradation of L-Leu-Bx under this condition to represent the overall very low degradation rate:

\[
t_{0.5 - betaxanthins} = 12.4\ {day} = 297.6\ h = 1.79 × 10^{4}\ {min} = 1.07 × 10^{6}\ {s}
\]

To verify the accuracy of the above estimate, we performed the following validation:

  

![Figure 4.4 betaxanthins degradation parameters under different pH and temperature condition(Rodríguez-Sánchez,2017)](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/betaxanthinsdegradation-hight-condition.webp)

![Figure 4.5 conditions at different pH or temperature.](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/betaxanthins-degradation-condition.webp)

It is easy to observe that the degradation half-life of betaxanthins at $pH$≈6.48, $T$=50.0°C is 17.41h. Based on the relationship between half-life and temperature, the half-life at room temperature (about 25°C) at the same pH will be much longer than 17h, supporting that within the modeling error tolerance, we can indeed ignore their degradation (when $t<8h$) or set it to a relatively long time.

# 4.7 Algorithm, Implementation  & Reproducibility

To implement the model, we comprehensively used the following algorithms to make the model more accurate and robust:

+ ^a. Innovatively introduced graph theory and graph algorithms for representation and computation.^

    We modeled based on a graph model. Nodes in the graph correspond to substances, and edges correspond to interactions between two adjacent nodes. We used Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the sum of appropriate specific path delay times for each node to determine their earliest signal output time.

+ ^b.Adopted a "flux method" for modeling node concentration changes.^

    For each node, its own concentration (intensity) is stored. For general nodes, the input and output rates of the node's concentration (intensity) can be determined based on the Delay Differential Equation (DDE) equations of upstream and downstream edges. Likening a node to a reservoir, the node's input and output rates can be compared to the inflow rate of the inlet pipe and the outflow rate of the outlet pipe, respectively.

+ ^c.Edge process modeling primarily based on Delay Differential Equations (DDE).^

    Except for relationships between two nodes that can be expressed using elementary function expressions, for general edges connecting two nodes, they are defined by Delay Differential Equations (DDE). However, since the delay time for most processes is zero, they can also appear as ODE equations. The specific implication of the delay effect is: for an interaction process A to B, the input/output rate calculated from the concentrations (intensities) of A and B at time t takes effect for A at time t, but for B, it only takes effect at time $t$ +$ t_{delay-time}$.

+ ^d. System dynamic simulation based on global iteration using Euler's method.^

    Using Euler's method, with a fixed time interval $Δt$, the DDE equations are converted into difference equations for iteration: $f(t+Δt) = f(t) + (rate_{inflow} - rate_{outflow}) * Δt$. We separately handled processes represented by elementary functions in the upstream (or downstream) interactions of nodes (setting their inflow or outflow rates to 0) in computation but handled them uniformly in iteration. This allows predicting the situation at every Δt interval in the future.

+ ^e.Stochastic process simulation based on the Monte Carlo method.^

    For each stochastic process, normally distributed random data were generated 100 times using the method offered by numpy kit, and the signal system behavior was simulated. Acceptable approximate results were obtained by approximating with probability statistics.

+ ^f. Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantification (LOQ) calculation using local interpolation.^

    Since $3\sigma_{blank}, 10\sigma_{blank}, and \mu_{blank}$ do not differ greatly numerically, linear interpolation was performed near the blank signal intensity to solve for the BoNT/A concentrations corresponding approximately to $ \mu_{blank} + 3\sigma_{blank} and \mu_{blank} + 10\sigma_{blank}.$ Within the allowable error range, these are sufficient as the LOD and LOQ.

+ ^g.Single-variable sensitivity analysis.^

    For each parameter to be analyzed, we set a perturbation of ±\delta = 10\%, obtaining perturbed parameter sets. Using each perturbed parameter with other unperturbed parameters, the DDE equations were solved to obtain the model output after perturbing a single parameter, which was compared with the unperturbed output.

    The sensitivity coefficient S was calculated using the unperturbed and perturbed output results. According to the formula for S, S represents the relative strength of the absolute value's influence. A larger absolute value of S means the change in S has the greatest impact on the final signal; the sign of S indicates the direction of the influence.

+ ^h.Global experiment on model parameter sensitivity.^

    We used Sobol indices to quantify the total influence of parameters on the output: Sobol parameters are (variance-based). The Sobol parameter method (is based on variance decomposition). We first used Saltelli sampling to select a large number of parameter combinations within the parameter range as experimental samples. For each sample, the DDE model was run, the output signal was recorded, and the $S1$ (influence of a single parameter on the output), $ST$ (total influence from single parameters to two-parameter interactions up to all parameter interactions), and $S2$ (interaction strength of two parameters) for each parameter were calculated through Sobol decomposition. Based on this, we evaluated the importance of each parameter and their interactions.

The Python project was the main tool for building, debugging the model, and generating modeling results. We created the graph data structure file `graph.py` and, based on this, performed Python coding for the deterministic model, Monte Carlo method random noise simulation and LOD/LOQ calculation, parameter sensitivity analysis, and plotting, etc.

![Figure 4.7 The interactive platform](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/html-demo-2.webp)

The interactive platform we designed has powerful and robust functionality, performance, and a user-friendly, intuitive human-computer interface. Its core functionality revolves around the dual-view of simulation results / model editor, supporting interactive editing of nodes and reaction equations, dynamic parameter configuration, `JSON` format model import/export, and still integrates noise simulation and LOD/LOQ calculation modules, capable of simulating the impact of different noise levels on the signal pathway. 

On the html, you can easily built the model you want by changing the parameter, and quickly export your results. For example, you can change the number of two strains to optimize the ratio of them. What's more it is a fascinating platform for us to debug our program using the data provided by future experiments

# 4.8 Results Analysis

+ ^Analysis of the Deterministic DDE Model^

    To simplify the analysis, we first studied the dose-response relationship between BoNT/A concentration and signal intensity when the ratio of upstream to downstream yeast numbers was 1:1.

    Over a concentration range from very small to very large (even exceeding the biological system's limit), the BoNT/A concentration and signal intensity overall exhibit a Hill equation relationship, which is similar to reports in multiple similar references, and the Hill coefficients are relatively close (n = 1.1 [1], n = 1 (this model)). Considering the characteristics of α-factor binding to the Ste2 receptor (Hill\ n = 1), this suggests that on a large scale, the signal intensity is mainly determined by the binding of α-factor and Ste2 receptors, while the downstream signaling pathway, metabolic pathway, and upstream BoNT/A cleavage do not show significant Hill effects, approximately presenting a linear relationship, which is also consistent with our model's assumptions.
    
![](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/bonta-dose-response-curve-28800s-ration-1-18to9.webp)



    In the concentration range more likely for actual biological systems (e.g., $[10^{-18} M, 10^{-5}M]$ ), the BoNT/A–signal curve shows a trend of first rising, then falling, approaching a plateau, and then continuing to rise. Preliminary analysis and estimation suggest that the declining trend and plateau characteristics may both be caused by the mutual cancellation between the increase in betaxanthin production with α-factor concentration and the increase in intermediate product degradation rate with α-factor concentration.

![Figure 4.8 ](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/bonta-dose-response-curve-28800-ration-1-18to-3.webp)

    Studying the working range of [ $10^{-18} M, 10^{-10} M$ ] (the exact working range needs to be determined after the code results are run), it was found that the relationship between BoNT/A concentration and signal intensity again shows approximately parabolic characteristics. This may indicate that in the working range, the effects of degradation and other factors on the sensor's performance must be considered, providing important clues for the next step of research.

![Figure 4.9](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/bonta-dose-response-28800s-ration-1-18-8.webp)

+ ^Optimization of Initial Upstream and Downstream Yeast Numbers for Experiments^

![Figure 4.10 final siganl vs BoNT/A concentration curve at diffenent Substrate-acting Strain and Signal-transferring Strain proportion($ration\_cell$)](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/final-system-ration-cell-demo.webp)

    • When the ratio of the two strains is relatively high(e.g.,greater than( $10^{-2}$ )),according to observations,within an 8-hour detection period,the concentration of botulinum toxin is the same,but the signal of betalain has not reached its current maximum.This may suggest that there is a relatively high amount of upstream fusion protein,and consequently,a relatively high amount of free α-factor produced by cleavage.Meanwhile,the proportion of the downstream strain( $1-ratio{cell}$ )is not sufficiently large,resulting in the free α-factor not being fully utilized by the downstream strain within 8 hours.This is sufficient to explain the phenomenon that as $ratio{cell}$ decreases,the signal intensity increases at the same time(8 hours)and the same concentration.

    • When the ratio of the two strains is very low(e.g.,less than $10^{-2}$ ),the betalain signal will eventually be captured by high concentrations of botulinum toxin within 8 hours.We estimate that around $10^{-2}$ will be the threshold for the full utilization of botulinum toxin.After the ratio of upstream and downstream strains decreases to around $10^{-2}$ ,the concentration of α-factor linked to the fusion protein on the surface of the upstream strain is also continuously decreasing,while the proportion of the downstream strain system is constantly increasing,approaching the environmental carrying capacity.At this point,from $ratio{cell}=10^{-2}$ down to a certain level,the free α-factor produced by the upstream strain can be almost fully utilized by the downstream strain.(We speculate that within this $ratio{cell} $ range,there may still be some α-factors not utilized by the downstream strain,but the proportion is low and not easily observable in the figure above)

    • We also anticipate that when the proportion of the upstream strain drops below a certain threshold,at lower concentrations of botulinum toxin,the α-factor can also be fully cleaved,bound,and degraded within 8 hours.At this point,it means that lower concentrations of BoNT/A are sufficient to degrade these α-factors.The curve may shift slightly to the left,but since the upstream α-factor is already very low and the BoNT/A concentration is converted to a logarithmic scale,the curves in the figure above almost completely overlap.

    • In summary,setting the ratio of the two strains( $ratio{cell}$ )below $10^{-2}$ will not help to enhance the signal.We even speculate that when the ratio of the two strains is too low,due to the limited release of α-factor,the signal curve may actually shift downward.

    • Looking at the overall trend,appropriately reducing the ratio of upstream and downstream strains(around $10^{-2}$ )will help to increase both the maximum signal intensity and the signal intensity at low concentrations.This is of great importance for the sensitive detection of instruments.

+ ^Stochastic Process Analysis and Calculation of LOD/LOQ^

    Based on our preliminary exploration of the two-strain ratio, we narrowed the scope and studied the LOD and LOQ for strain ratios within $[10^{-6}, 10^{-3}]$. The results are as follows:

    ![Figure 4.11](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/lod-loq-ration-cell.webp)


    We found that within this interval, the ratio of upstream to downstream strains has little impact on the LOD and LOQ. We can take the strain ratio as $10^{-5}$. According to the calculation results, the minimum LOD reached in this interval is: $LOD_{min} = 2.20 × 10^{-12} M$. When the strain ratio is $10^{-6}$, the corresponding minimum LOQ is $LOQ_{min} = 5.11 × 10^{-12} M$. Therefore, we can use these values to represent the sensitivity of the current design.
    
+ ^Single Parameter Sensitivity Analysis^

    Simulation results indicate that parameter sensitivity itself is related to the evaluation time and the set variation rate. It is certain that due to the chain of reactions and the set delay effects, the parameter sensitivity coefficients also have temporal stages. The variation rate mainly affects the absolute value of the parameter sensitivity to some extent, with little impact on the overall trend.

    Preliminary analysis is also relatively obvious: in the early stages of testing, the activation level of downstream reactions is small, and the signal intensity is mainly determined by upstream delay times and parameters; as the reaction time extends to 8 hours, downstream intermediate products increase significantly, and ultimately the importance of downstream parameters gradually increases; simultaneously, because the concentrations of most substances increase overall, the stability of the signal system itself also improves systematically, and the absolute values of various parameters gradually converge from 2 hours to 8 hours.

![Figure 4.12](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/single-parameter-sensitivity-analysis.webp)

    We analyzed the parameter sensitivity values at 8 hours for various variation rates and found:
    
    - From the ranking of the absolute values of sensitivity, we can Screen out the key parameters ($EC_{50}$, $k_{transcription-pGAL1-max}$, $kcat_{MjDOD}$, etc.) and corresponding processes (α-factor binding to Ste2 receptor, pGAL1 promoter transcription maximum, MjDOD catalytic turnover, etc.); in contrast, some processes are also significantly unimportant (such as protein and betaxanthin degradation, time delays, etc.).
    
    - The change in parameter sensitivity with different variation rates also reflects the importance of parameters and processes. We observed that at variation rates of 10\%, 30\%, and 45\%, parameters like $EC_{50}$, k_{transcription-pGAL1-max}, and k_{betalamicacid-to-betaxanthins} ranked at the top of parameter sensitivity, further indicating their importance. Meanwhile, as the parameter variation rate increases, the importance of Km_bonta continuously rises, suggesting the importance of confirming the kinetic parameters of BoNT/A under conditions of high parameter uncertainty.
    
    - At 2.0h, 4.0h, and 8.0h under different parameter variation rates, the types of positively and negatively correlated parameters are basically constant. However, the α-factor degradation half-life $half\_life\_alphafactor $ shows a phenomenon of negative correlation in the short term and positive correlation in the long term, but the specific cause of this change needs further exploration and discussion. Currently, there is no good conclusion, and this will be our next task.

Looking across the various set evaluation times and parameter variation rates, some parameters show obvious high sensitivity, and they are the focus of our next step in parameter investigation and experimental verification.

+ ^Global Parameter Sensitivity Analysis^

    Although single-parameter sensitivity analysis is relatively simple, it struggles to uncover the effects of interactions between parameters on experimental results. Furthermore, the "single-parameter sensitivity analysis" algorithm explored earlier is also quite simple and cannot fully reflect the impact of parameter changes on the outcomes. We conducted a global parameter sensitivity analysis using the Sobol algorithm, focusing on capturing the influence of parameter interactions on experimental results.

    Since the Sobol algorithm is based on statistical variance decomposition, its mathematical essence differs from the linear analysis used in the aforementioned univariate sensitivity analysis. Therefore, its results under the same conditions may differ from the previous method, but this simultaneously provides us with another perspective for analyzing the problem.

    We analyzed in detail the global parameter sensitivity analysis results at 8 hours with parameter variation rates (Δ) of $20%$ and $30%$, respectively. As shown in the figures below, we found the two situations to be quite similar. Therefore, we combined the analysis, found many conclusions consistent with the single-parameter analysis, and use the $30%$ variation rate for the following presentation:

    It must be specially declared that the following analysis no longer includes the time delays and the reaction rate constant for the spontaneous betaxanthin reaction within the scope of parameter sensitivity research. Due to time constraints, only the sensitivities of the following parameters were studied, which differs from the previous section.

![Figure 4.13](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/global-sensitivity-analysis.webp)

![Figure 4.14](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/heatmap-of-parameter-interaction.webp)

![Figure 4.15](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/dynamic-change-of-parameter-sensitivity.webp)

![Figure 4.16](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/parameter-sensitivity-contribution.webp)

    - Under long duration (8h) and a high variation rate ($30%$), the Km value of BoNT/A becomes one of the most sensitive parameters. However, its sensitivity profile differs somewhat from most other nodes, manifesting more through interactions with other nodes. This may suggest its own significant impact on the results and its high correlation with other parameters.

    - Important parameters such as $k_{transcription-GAL1-max}$, $EC_{50}$, and $kcat_{MjDOD}$ still rank highly.

    But simultaneously, by considering interactions, we observed that the interactions between parameters reveal more meaningful properties:

    - $EC_{50}$ and $Km_{BoNT/A}$ represent the binding of the beneficial α-factor and the enzyme's binding to the fixed α-factor (fusion protein), respectively. They exhibit a highly coupled upstream-downstream relationship.

    - We understand that in complex, highly coupled biochemical systems, the Total-order index (ST) is often several times higher than the First-order index (S1). Our analysis results also show this trend. Parameters where the difference $(ST - S1)$ constitutes a larger proportion of $ST$ might indicate they are crucial for system connectivity, prompting us to focus on them more in the next steps.

    - Investigating the effect of evaluation time on parameter sensitivity reveals that extending time helps to bring the sensitivity levels of various parameters closer, which aligns with our findings from the single-parameter sensitivity study. While the sensitivity of most parameters decreases slightly and slowly, the sensitivity of the parameter for the α-factor and Ste2 receptor internalization half-life shows a certain increase, possibly due to the long-term and lagged effects of α-factor degradation on Ste2 receptor and α-factor concentration.

# 4.9 Guidance to Wet Lab

The above model results and findings have already had an important impact on experimental work:

- We determined that the optimal input ratio of the two yeast strains (Substrate-acting Strain and Signal transferring Strain) before the reaction, which minimizes the Limit of Detection (LOD) and Limit of Quantitations(LOQ) at an 8-hour reaction time, can be as low as 0.01. Lower ratios have no significant meaning for experiments, thus determining the best initial reaction conditions.

- The model's prediction of the relationship between signal, time, and BoNT/A concentration provides clues for controlling reaction time and narrows down the possible concentration range of initial substrates in real experiments and simulation experiments. Our next simulation experiments can focus on the region near the predicted LOD and LOQ, avoiding scanning over an extremely large concentration range.

- The model's analysis of local and global parameter sensitivity implies that it will be necessary to strengthen experiments and data collection on sensitive parameters in the next step, guiding the focus of future experimental work.

We also shared the modeling process and results synchronously with the entire team through intuitive forms like `html` web pages, promoting the exchange and dissemination of knowledge within the team.

Of course, experimental work itself is the source of modeling. The continuous collection and organization of experimental data and experimental intelligence have helped us determine and confirm some processes, initial conditions, and parameters:

a. We determined the initial concentration of L-DOPA; and through discussion with the Wet lab, determined the initial value of the system's amino acid concentration.

b. Through analysis of wet lab raw data, we plotted the overall absorption spectrum of the pathway from MjDOD catalyzing L-DOPA to betalamic acid and downstream, confirming that the overall maximum absorption peak is around 480nm.

c. We collaborated with the Wet Lab to further design improvement plans for future work based on the modeling results, such as adding verification experiments and improving the expression system.

The above shows the close connection between the model and experiments.

# 4.10 Discussion& Future Work

This model successfully derived the BoNT/A–signal intensity dose-response curves at different specific times and successfully predicted the LOD and LOQ by introducing randomness. This is the final realization and effect test of the model design. It indicates the effectiveness and shortcomings of the current design and guides the next round of optimized design. The analysis of parameter sensitivity reminds us to focus on confirming and optimizing some parameters.

Although the form of this model is similar to conventional ODE modeling of signaling and metabolic pathways, we still strived for innovation in the model: we imaginatively linked the pathway to a "graph," preserving the structural characteristics of the network while enabling quantitative simulation of dynamic processes, providing a new perspective for time-varying analysis of complex biological networks.

We introduced Monte Carlo simulation based on Gaussian random noise in key processes of the biological system. Compared with general noise simulation methods, the idea and implementation are simpler, and it is easy to flexibly adjust the noise level. Layered noise processing also conforms to the laws of biological systems. The combination of signal pathways and graph theory introduced Dijkstra's algorithm into signal pathway research and also gave rise to our application of Delay Differential Equations (DDEs).

We developed a web simulation platform with good scalability and intuitiveness, which helps promote knowledge dissemination. Its degree of personalization can also be higher than conventional software like COPASI, while reducing the learning cost for beginners to get started with pathway modeling.

Of course, no modeling of biological systems can be called completely correct, and our model is no exception. Due to the great uncertainty of the parameters themselves, the simplification of linear equation expressions, the neglect of secondary processes, and the inherent chaos of biological systems, our model must have many defects, such as insufficient capture of important processes in the pathway and large discrepancies in predicted data.

Furthermore, due to the rush in research time, our model also has many unfinished tasks. Our research on the optimal ratio of the two strains and parameter sensitivity is still in its early stages, while the stability and robustness of the analysis are not strong enough, and we have not fully explored the connotations and deep relationships behind them. Although generally consistent, our linear model also showed some inconsistencies with reality in simulations. We will bravely face challenges and difficulties, constantly evolving with the help of the "Design-Build-Test-Learn" research flywheel.

Nevertheless, our model has already provided us with much useful information. The exploration of the optimal ratio of the two strains, the study of LOD and LOQ, and the analysis of local and global sensitivity reminds us that the subsequent work plan should focus on the above issues, such as model parameter optimization, process tuning, and initial condition optimization.

We will deeply communicate with the Wet Lab to determine the best parameter values, and by comparing with experimental results, uncovering overlooked channels, better practicing the "Design-Build-Test-Learn" cycle. We will introduce more reasonable randomness and uncertainty analysis to enhance the robustness of LOD and LOQ analysis. Driven by the dual wheels of experiment and modeling, we will refine and optimize the reliability of the project design, striving to design a stable and sensitive biosensing system. We will also try to introduce more graph theory methods into biological system modeling, providing unique research perspectives.

We will also further clarify the development direction and content of the web platform, try to integrate more powerful functions, and inherit the intuitive and easy-to-understand nature, turning it into a more inclusive and practical learning platform, making it easy to get started  biological system modeling.

# 5 Optimize the ratio of Substrate-acting Strain and Signal-transferring Strain

^1. Introduction^

The co-culture of Substrate-acting Strain and Signal-transferring Strain is the foundation of our system's communication mechanism. Substrate-acting strain secrete α-factor, while Signal-transferring strain detect and respond to it through the Ste2p receptor pathway. To ensure effective communication, the ratio between Substrate-acting Strain and Signal-transferring Strain is crucial: too few Substrate-acting Strains lead to insufficient signaling, while too many Substrate-acting Strains cause signal saturation and resource waste.

Therefore, we constructed ^three^ mathematical models to explore how the Substrate-acting Strain-to-Signal-transferring Strain ratio influences α-factor distribution and receptor activation.^Since the quantities of the two strains in the initial system have reached to maximum , we do not consider the competition during yeast reproduction in the model.^ By quantitatively describing the balance between α-factor production, diffusion, and uptake, our model aims to identify the optimal ratio that maximizes signaling efficiency. This provides both a theoretical explanation for the experimental observations and guidance for adjusting proportions in the wet lab.

# 5.1 Model 1: 

^1. Model Assumptions^

    a. The spatial transport of α-factor between Substrate-acting Strain and Signal-transferring Strain can be approximated as one-dimensional diffusion, since the main direction of α-factor transfer is from Substrate-acting Strain cells to signal cells across the medium.

    b. α-factor degradation within the bulk medium is negligible on the time scale of interest; removal occurs primarily via boundary uptake.

    c. The system operates under steady temperature and homogeneous medium conditions, so the diffusion coefficient $D$ is constant.

^2. Equation Construction^

The α-factor concentration $C(x,t)$ is modeled by a one-dimensional diffusion equation over the domain $x\in[0,L]$:\[\frac{\partial{C}}{\partial{x}}=D\frac{\partial^2{C}}{\partial{x^2}}\]
The Substrate-acting Strain at $x=0$ secrete α-factor as a flux source $R$,while the Signal-transferring Strain at $x=L$ absorb it through a constant uptake flux $J_0$. Thus, the boundary conditions are:\[-D\frac{\partial{C}}{\partial{x}}(0,t)=R,\quad -D\frac{\partial{C}}{\partial{x}}(L,t)=R\]
The production rate follows a Michaelis–Menten form,\[R=\frac{K_{cat}[BoNT][SNAP]_{total}}{K_m+[SNAP]_{total}}\]while the uptake rate is approximated as a constant $J_0=k_3N_{recv}$,independent of local concentration.

^3. Parameter List^

| Parameter | Meaning | Value | Unit | Reference |
|:---:| :---:| :---:| :---:| :---: |
|$D$ |Diffusion coefficient of α-factor in the medium|$2.18×10^{-10}$ |$m^2/s$ | [3] |
|$C(x,t)$ |Concentration of α-factor at position $x$ and time $t$ |   |$mol/m^3$ | |
|$K_{cat}$ |Turnover number of BoNT acting on SNAP-25|$60$ |$s^{-1}$ | [1] |
|$K_m$ |Michaelis constant of SNAP-25 cleavage by BoNT|$1.62\pm0.6$ |$\mu M$ | [1] |
|$k_3$ |Effective constant uptake coefficient at Signal-transferring Strain|$1× 10^{-7}$ |$mol/(cell· s)$ | estimated |


^4. Equation Solve^

This PDE is solved numerically using the finite element method (FEM). The weak form yields a semi-discrete system\[\textbf{M}\frac{d\textbf{u}}{dt}+D\textbf{Ku}=\textbf{F}(t)-\textbf{G}(t),\]where $\textbf{M}$ and $\textbf{K}$ are the standard FEM mass and stiffness matrices, and $\textbf{F}$,$\textbf{G}$ represent the production and uptake fluxes at the boundaries. Time integration is performed using the implicit Euler scheme:\[(\textbf{M}+\Delta tD\textbf{K})\textbf{u}^{n+1}=\textbf{Mu}^n+\Delta t(\textbf{F}^{n+1}-\textbf{G}^{n+1})\]The cumulative absorbed amount is then obtained by integrating $J_0$ over time.

^5. Result^

We scanned the Substrate-acting Strain fraction $p$ from 0.01 to 0.99 and computed the cumulative α-factor uptake $J_2$ by the Signal-transferring Strain using our 1D diffusion model. The results show that the optimal ratio requires a significantly higher number of Signal-transferring Strain compared to Substrate-acting Strain. In other words, effective communication is achieved when Signal-transferring Strain dominate the population, allowing them to efficiently capture α-factor produced by fewer Substrate-acting Strains.

![Figure 5.1](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/ra1.webp)

^6. Conclusion^

The model suggests that Signal-transferring Strain should outnumber Substrate-acting Strain to maximize cumulative uptake, with Substrate-acting Strains forming only a small fraction of the population. This ensures sufficient α-factor signaling without saturation. While some parameters, like the uptake coefficient $k_3$ , are estimated, the qualitative trend is robust: increasing Signal-transferring Strain improves overall signaling efficiency. 

# 5.2 Model 2:

To verify the correctness of the model, we also used the modeling program employed in the entire process simulation of the system to model the proportioning.

^1. Method^

The total number of the two types of strains remains unchanged.(2e11 cells/L,[5])The concentration of Signal-transferring strain decides the concentration of ste2 receptor,while the concentration of Substrate-acting strain decides the  concentration of Snap25.

More Signal-transferring strain leads to higher possibility of ste2 receptors coming into contact with alpha factors ,thus more more betaxanthin would be produced  which means the color are easier to recognize. 

Meanwhile more Substrate-acting strain leads to more snap 25, thus more α-factor would be freed which means more ste2 would be actived.

\[C_{Signal-transferring}=C_{snap25}/x\]

In the entire process simulation of the system, the concentration of snap25 is related to that of Substrate-acting as mentioned above. Therefore, I can adjust the number of cells by regulating the concentration of snap25.

\[C_{Substrate-acting}+C_{Signal-transferring}=K_{cell}\]

\[ratio=\frac{C_{Signal-transferring}}{K_{cell}}\]

| Parameter | Meaning | Value | Unit | Reference |
|:---:| :---:| :---:| :---:| :---: |
|$C_{snap25}$ |The concentration of Substrate-acting strain within the system|-|$M$ | - |
|$x$ |the number of snap25 on each Substrate-acting strain |3000|1| estimated |
|$C_{Substrate-acting}$ |The cell concentration of Substrate-acting strain within the system|-| $cells/L$ | - |
|$C_{Signal-transferring}$ |The cell concentration of Signal-transferring strain within the system|-| $cells/L$ |-|
| $K_{cell}$ |Environmental carrying capacity for two strains in YPD| $2×10^{11}$ | $cells/L$ | [7] |

^2. Result^

![Figure 5.2](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/rat2.webp)

By altering the  the proportion of signal-transferring strains  in the entire strain in its system, we obtained the maximum signal intensity corresponding to a response of 50,000 seconds for different botulinum toxin concentrations. We could find that the more the signal-transferring strains ,the stronger the signal. The plot shows the same trend as the results obtained from the previous modeling, verifying the correctness of the proportioning modeling.

![Figure 5.3](https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5924/drylab/qujian.webp)

At the same time, we also found that the the effective concentration range of botulinum toxin in the test kit vary with different ratios.We can find that the higher the proportion, the better the system performs at low concentrations (1e-16M), and the lower the proportion, the better the system performs at higher concentrations (1e-15M).



# 5.3 Model 3:
In this model, we constructed a kinetic network for α-factor release and binding, incorporating competition between the two strains. In the signal-transferring strain, the native Gal4 promoter in the genome was deleted. According to previous studies, deletion of the genomic Gal4 promoter markedly reduces yeast growth rate [6]. Therefore, the substrate-acting strain exhibits a faster growth rate than the signal-transferring strain. 

^1.Method^

The dynamics of the system are captured by the following set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs):

\[\frac{d[U]}{dt} = r_U · [U]· (1-\frac{[U]+[D]}{C_{tot}})\]

\[\frac{d[D]}{dt} = r_D · [D]· (1-\frac{[U]+[D]}{C_{tot}})\]

\[\frac{d[A]}{dt} = v_{cut}- k_{on} [A][R_f]+k_{off}[R_b]\]

\[\frac{d[R_b]}{dt} = k_{on}[A][R_f]- k_{off} [R_b]-k_{int}[R_b]\]

\[\frac{d[R_f]}{dt} = -k_{on}[A][R_f]+ k_{off} [R_b]+R_{0c}· \frac{d[D]}{dt}\]

\[\frac{d[F_u]}{dt} = -v_{cut}+F_{0c}· \frac{d[U]}{dt}\]

\[v_{cut}=\frac{k_{cat}· [F_u]· Toxin}{K_m+[F_u]}\]

\[\frac{d[S]}{dt} = k_s[R_b]\]

^4. Result ^

The results show that the signal intensity reaches its maximum when (f = 0.5), corresponding to a 1:1 ratio of substrate-acting strain to signal-transferring strain.

# 5.4 Discussion:

During the modeling of signal transmission efficiency in a two-strain co-culture system, we employed three distinct approaches to simulate the binding of α-factor to the Ste2 receptor and downstream signal activation.

In the first model, we assumed each signal-transferring cell produces a fixed signal, independent of the surrounding α-factor concentration: 

\[
J_0 = k_3 N_{recv}
\]

Under this assumption, the total signal depends only on the product of single-cell signal and signal-transferring strain number. As a result, the model fails to accurately reflect the contribution of the substrate-acting strain, particularly when the free α-factor concentration is low (i.e., at low substrate-acting strain proportions).

Next, the second model incorporates concentration-dependent signaling, using an EC50-like formulation to describe signal strength:

\[
\theta = \frac{c_{\alpha\text{-factor-free}}}{EC50_{\text{ste2}} + c_{\alpha\text{-factor-free}}}
\]

This model reflects signal enhancement with rising α-factor levels and includes a saturation limit via EC50. Since θ is restricted between 0 and 1, the total signal (i.e., the product of θ and signal-transferring cell number) remains strongly dependent only on the number of signal-transferring cells.

Finally, the third model simulates signal activation using ligand–receptor binding kinetics:

\[
\frac{d[R_b]}{dt} = k_{\text{on}}[A][R_f] - k_{\text{off}} [R_b] - k_{\text{int}} [R_b]
\]

In this model, if the total cell number is $N$ and the proportion of producer cells is $p$, the amount of α-factor produced is approximately proportional to $pN$. The uptake rate is roughly proportional to both the α-factor concentration and the number of signal-transferring cells. As a result, regardless of other parameter changes, the total uptake follows a quadratic function proportional to $p(1-p)$, reaching its maximum near (p = 0.5), indicating a balanced contribution from both upstream and downstream strains.

# 5.5 Advice:

Based on our modeling results, we recommend that future experiments explore two approaches: (1) maintaining a high proportion of signal-transferring cells relative to substrate-acting cells, and (2) keeping the ratio of signal-transferring to substrate-acting cells close to 1:1. The optimal strategy should be further validated through wet-lab experiments.
